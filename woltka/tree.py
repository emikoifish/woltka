"""Functions for handling hierarchical classification systems.

Notes
-----
A hierarchical classification system is represented by a tree, which is a dict
of taxon ID to parent taxon ID. Each taxon ID is a unique identifier (such as
NCBI TaxID), although a descriptive name (e.g., "Escherichia coli") may work as
long as it is unique. The root of the tree is indicated by ID == parent ID. The
terminal leaves of the tree are IDs of subjects to which input data are mapped.
This simple data structure is sufficient for the purpose of this program.

In addition, the name and rank assignments of taxa are recorded in two separate
dicts, if available. In principle, the system is rank-independent (i.e., "rank"
can be anything or left empty).

    function aims as defining a root for any given tree. Specifically, if
    there is one root node (highest hierarchy), this node will be "sealed"
    (making parent as itself). If there are multiple crown nodes ("crown"
    describes the root of a clade instead of the entire tree), a new root
    node will be generated and serve as the parent of all crown nodes.
